Delta Chat ASYNC  (friedel, bjoern, floris, friedel)

- smtp fake-idle/load jobs gerade noch alle fuenf sekunden , sollte alle zehn minuten (oder gar nicht)

APIs:
    dc_context_new                 # opens the database
    dc_open                             # FFI only
      -> drop it and move parameters to dc_context_new()

    dc_configure                      # note: dc_start_jobs() is NOT allowed to run concurrently
    dc_imex NEVER goes through the job system
    dc_imex import_backup needs to ensure dc_stop_jobs()
    dc_jobs_are_running()      # tell if we are in start/stop-jobs state

    dc_context_run                 # start async scheduler
      -> dc_start_jobs
    dc_context_shutdown       # Stop async scheduler (after return no async-task runs)
      -> dc_stop_jobs
    dc_close                            # FFI only
      -> can be dropped
    dc_context_unref

    for ios share-extension:
    Int dc_direct_send()  -> try send out without going through jobs system, but queue a job in db if it needs to be retried on failure
        0: message was sent
        1: message failed to go out, is queued as a job to be retried later
        2: message permanently failed?

EVENT handling:
    start a callback thread and call get_next_event() which is BLOCKING
    it's fine to start this callback thread later, it will see all events.
    Note that the core infinitely fills the internal queue if you never drain it.

    FFI-get_next_event() returns NULL if the context is unrefed already?

   sidenote: how python's callback thread does it currently:
         CB-thread runs this while loop:
         while not QUITFLAG:
             ev = context.get_next_event( )
             ...
         So in order to shutdown properly one has to set QUITFLAG
         before calling dc_stop_jobs() and dc_context_unref

    event API:
        get_data1_int
        get_data2_int
        get_data3_str


- userdata likely only used for the callbacks, likely can be dropped, needs verification


- iOS needs for the share app to call "try_send_smtp" wihtout a full dc_context_run and without going
