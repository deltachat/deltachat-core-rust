# In unoptimised builds tokio tends to use a lot of stack space when
# creating some complicated futures, tokio has an open issue for this:
# https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/issues/2055.  Some of our tests
# manage to not fit in the default 2MiB stack anymore due to this, so
# while the issue is not resolved we want to work around this.
# Because compiling optimised builds takes a very long time we prefer
# to avoid that.  Setting this environment variable ensures that when
# invoking `cargo test` threads are allowed to have a large enough
# stack size without needing to use an optimised build.
