/**
 * @mainpage Getting started
 *
 * This document describes how to handle the Delta Chat core library.
 * For general information about Delta Chat itself,
 * see <https://delta.chat> and <https://github.com/deltachat>.
 *
 * Let's start.
 *
 * First of all, you have to **create a context object**
 * bound to a database.
 * The database is a normal SQLite file with a "blob directory" beside it.
 * This will create "example.db" database and "example.db-blobs"
 * directory if they don't exist already:
 *
 * ~~~
 * dc_context_t* context = dc_context_new(NULL, "example.db", NULL);
 * ~~~
 *
 * After that, make sure you can **receive events from the context**.
 * For that purpose, create an event emitter you can ask for events.
 * If there is no event, the emitter will wait until there is one,
 * so, in many situations, you will do this in a thread:
 *
 * ~~~
 * void* event_handler(void* context)
 * {
 *     dc_event_emitter_t* emitter = dc_get_event_emitter(context);
 *     dc_event_t* event;
 *     while ((event = dc_get_next_event(emitter)) != NULL) {
 *         // use the event as needed, e.g. dc_event_get_id() returns the type.
 *         // once you're done, unref the event to avoid memory leakage:
 *         dc_event_unref(event);
 *     }
 *     dc_event_emitter_unref(emitter);
 * }
 *
 * static pthread_t event_thread;
 * pthread_create(&event_thread, NULL, event_handler, context);
 * ~~~
 *
 * The example above uses "pthreads",
 * however, you can also use anything else for thread handling.
 *
 * Now you can **configure the context:**
 *
 * ~~~
 * // use some real test credentials here
 * dc_set_config(context, "addr", "alice@example.org");
 * dc_set_config(context, "mail_pw", "***");
 * dc_configure(context);
 * ~~~
 *
 * dc_configure() returns immediately.
 * The configuration itself runs in the background and may take a while.
 * Once done, the #DC_EVENT_CONFIGURE_PROGRESS reports success
 * to the event_handler() you've defined above.
 *
 * The configuration result is saved in the database.
 * On subsequent starts it is not needed to call dc_configure()
 * (you can check this using dc_is_configured()).
 *
 * On a successfully configured context,
 * you can finally **connect to the servers:**
 *
 * ~~~
 * dc_start_io(context);
 * ~~~
 *
 * Now you can **send the first message:**
 *
 * ~~~
 * // use a real testing address here
 * uint32_t contact_id = dc_create_contact(context, NULL, "bob@example.org");
 * uint32_t chat_id    = dc_create_chat_by_contact_id(context, contact_id);
 *
 * dc_send_text_msg(context, chat_id, "Hi, here is my first message!");
 * ~~~
 *
 * dc_send_text_msg() returns immediately;
 * the sending itself is done in the background.
 * If you check the testing address (bob),
 * you should receive a normal e-mail.
 * Answer this e-mail in any e-mail program with "Got it!",
 * and the IO you started above will **receive the message**.
 *
 * You can then **list all messages** of a chat as follows:
 *
 * ~~~
 * dc_array_t* msglist = dc_get_chat_msgs(context, chat_id, 0, 0);
 * for (int i = 0; i < dc_array_get_cnt(msglist); i++)
 * {
 *     uint32_t  msg_id = dc_array_get_id(msglist, i);
 *     dc_msg_t* msg    = dc_get_msg(context, msg_id);
 *     char*     text   = dc_msg_get_text(msg);
 *
 *     printf("Message %i: %s\n", i+1, text);
 *
 *     dc_str_unref(text);
 *     dc_msg_unref(msg);
 * }
 * dc_array_unref(msglist);
 * ~~~
 *
 * This will output the following two lines:
 *
 * ~~~
 * Message 1: Hi, here is my first message!
 * Message 2: Got it!
 * ~~~
 *
 *
 * ## Thread safety
 *
 * All deltachat-core functions, unless stated otherwise, are thread-safe.
 * In particular, it is safe to pass the same dc_context_t pointer
 * to multiple functions running concurrently in different threads.
 *
 * All the functions are guaranteed not to use the reference passed to them
 * after returning. If the function spawns a long-running process,
 * such as dc_configure() or dc_imex(), it will ensure that the objects
 * passed to them are not deallocated as long as they are needed.
 * For example, it is safe to call dc_imex(context, ...) and
 * call dc_context_unref(context) immediately after return from dc_imex().
 * It is however **not safe** to call dc_context_unref(context) concurrently
 * until dc_imex() returns, because dc_imex() may have not increased
 * the reference count of dc_context_t yet.
 *
 * This means that the context may be still in use after
 * dc_context_unref() call.
 * For example, it is possible to start the import/export process,
 * call dc_context_unref(context) immediately after
 * and observe #DC_EVENT_IMEX_PROGRESS events via the event emitter.
 * Once dc_get_next_event() returns NULL,
 * it is safe to terminate the application.
 *
 * It is recommended to create dc_context_t in the main thread
 * and only call dc_context_unref() once other threads that may use it,
 * such as the event loop thread, are terminated.
 * Common mistake is to use dc_context_unref() as a way
 * to cause dc_get_next_event() return NULL and terminate event loop this way.
 * If event loop thread is inside a function taking dc_context_t
 * as an argument at the moment dc_context_unref() is called on the main thread,
 * the behavior is undefined.
 *
 * Recommended way to safely terminate event loop
 * and shutdown the application is
 * to use a boolean variable
 * indicating that the event loop should stop
 * and check it in the event loop thread
 * every time before calling dc_get_next_event().
 * To terminate the event loop, main thread should:
 * 1. Notify background threads,
 *    such as event loop (blocking in dc_get_next_event())
 *    and message processing loop (blocking in dc_wait_next_msgs()),
 *    that they should terminate by atomically setting the
 *    boolean flag in the memory
 *    shared between the main thread and background loop threads.
 * 2. Call dc_stop_io() or dc_accounts_stop_io(), depending
 *    on whether a single account or account manager is used.
 *    Stopping I/O is guaranteed to emit at least one event
 *    and interrupt the event loop even if it was blocked on dc_get_next_event().
 *    Stopping I/O is guaranteed to interrupt a single dc_wait_next_msgs().
 * 3. Wait until the event loop thread notices the flag,
 *    exits the event loop and terminates.
 * 4. Call dc_context_unref() or dc_accounts_unref().
 * 5. Keep calling dc_get_next_event() in a loop until it returns NULL,
 *    indicating that the contexts are deallocated.
 * 6. Terminate the application.
 *
 * When using C API via FFI in runtimes that use automatic memory management,
 * such as CPython, JVM or Node.js, take care to ensure the correct
 * shutdown order and avoid calling dc_context_unref() or dc_accounts_unref()
 * on the objects still in use in other threads,
 * e.g. by keeping a reference to the wrapper object.
 * The details depend on the runtime being used.
 *

 * For a class reference, see the "Classes" link atop.
 *
 *
 * ## Further hints
 *
 * Here are some additional, unsorted hints that may be useful.
 *
 * - For `get`-functions, you have to unref the return value in some way.
 *
 * - Strings in function arguments or return values are usually UTF-8 encoded.
 *
 * - The issue-tracker for the core library is here:

 * - `only_fetch_mvbox` = 1=Do not fetch messages from folders other than the

 *                    Messages are deleted whether they were seen or not, the UI should clearly point that out.
 *                    See also dc_estimate_deletion_cnt().
 * - `delete_server_after` = 0=do not delete messages from server automatically (default),
 *                    1=delete messages directly after receiving from server, mvbox is skipped.
 *                    >1=seconds, after which messages are deleted automatically from the server, mvbox is used as defined.
 *                    "Saved messages" are deleted from the server as well as
 *                    e-mails matching the `show_emails` settings above, the UI should clearly point that out.
 *                    See also dc_estimate_deletion_cnt().
 * - `media_quality` = DC_MEDIA_QUALITY_BALANCED (0) =

 *                    DC_MEDIA_QUALITY_WORSE (1)
 *                    allow worse images/videos/voice quality to gain smaller sizes,
 *                    suitable for providers or areas known to have a bad connection.
 *                    The library uses the `media_quality` setting to use different defaults
 *                    for recoding images sent with type #DC_MSG_IMAGE.
 *                    If needed, recoding other file types is up to the UI.
 * - `webrtc_instance` = webrtc instance to use for videochats in the form
 *                    `[basicwebrtc:|jitsi:]https://example.com/subdir#roomname=$ROOM`
 *                    if the URL is prefixed by `basicwebrtc`, the server is assumed to be of the type
 *                    https://github.com/cracker0dks/basicwebrtc which some UIs have native support for.
 *                    The type `jitsi:` may be handled by external apps.
 *                    If no type is prefixed, the videochat is handled completely in a browser.
 * - `bot`          = Set to "1" if this is a bot.
 *                    Prevents adding the "Device messages" and "Saved messages" chats,
 *                    adds Auto-Submitted header to outgoing messages,
 *                    accepts contact requests automatically (calling dc_accept_chat() is not needed),
 *                    does not cut large incoming text messages,
 *                    handles existing messages the same way as new ones if `fetch_existing_msgs=1`.
 * - `last_msg_id` = database ID of the last message processed by the bot.
 *                   This ID and IDs below it are guaranteed not to be returned
 *                   by dc_get_next_msgs() and dc_wait_next_msgs().
 *                   The value is updated automatically
 *                   when dc_markseen_msgs() is called,
 *                   but the bot can also set it manually if it processed
 *                   the message but does not want to mark it as seen.
 *                   For most bots calling `dc_markseen_msgs()` is the
 *                   recommended way to update this value
 *                   even for self-sent messages.
 * - `fetch_existing_msgs` = 0=do not fetch existing messages on configure (default),
 *                    1=fetch most recent existing messages on configure.
 *                    In both cases, existing recipients are added to the contact database.
 * - `disable_idle` = 1=disable IMAP IDLE even if the server supports it,
 *                    0=use IMAP IDLE if the server supports it.
 *                    This is a developer option used for testing polling used as an IDLE fallback.
 * - `download_limit` = Messages up to this number of bytes are downloaded automatically.
 *                    For larger messages, only the header is downloaded and a placeholder is shown.
 *                    These messages can be downloaded fully using dc_download_full_msg() later.
 *                    The limit is compared against raw message sizes, including headers.
 *                    The actually used limit may be corrected
 *                    to not mess up with non-delivery-reports or read-receipts.
 *                    0=no limit (default).
 *                    Changes affect future messages only.
 * - `protect_autocrypt` = Enable Header Protection for Autocrypt header.
 *                    This is an experimental option not compatible to other MUAs
 *                    and older Delta Chat versions.

 *   the message contains a text-area with some descriptive text
 *   and a URL that can be opened in a supported browser to join the videochat.

 *   encrypted with the passphrase given as `param2`. If `param2` is NULL or empty string,
 *   the backup is not encrypted.
 *   The backup contains all contacts, chats, images and other data and device independent settings.
 *   The backup does not contain device dependent settings as ringtones or LED notification settings.
 *   The name of the backup is `delta-chat-backup-<day>-<number>-<addr>.tar`.
 *
 * - **DC_IMEX_IMPORT_BACKUP** (12) - `param1` is the file (not: directory) to import. `param2` is the passphrase.
 *   The file is normally created by DC_IMEX_EXPORT_BACKUP and detected by dc_imex_has_backup(). Importing a backup
 *   is only possible as long as the context is not configured or used in another way.
 *
 * - **DC_IMEX_EXPORT_SELF_KEYS** (1) - Export all private keys and all public keys of the user to the
 *   directory given as `param1`. The default key is written to the files `public-key-default.asc`
 *   and `private-key-default.asc`, if there are more keys, they are written to files as
 *   `public-key-<id>.asc` and `private-key-<id>.asc`
 *
 * - **DC_IMEX_IMPORT_SELF_KEYS** (2) - Import private keys found in the directory given as `param1`.
 *   The last imported key is made the default keys unless its name contains the string `legacy`. Public keys are not imported.
 *   If `param1` is a filename, import the private key from the file and make it the default.

 * (the count of chats is known by dc_chatlist_get_cnt()).
 *
 * Only for the items that are in view
 * (the list may have several hundreds chats),
 * the UI should call dc_chatlist_get_summary() then.
 * dc_chatlist_get_summary() provides all elements needed for painting the item.
 *
 * On a click of such an item,
 * the UI should change to the chat view
 * and get all messages from this view via dc_get_chat_msgs().
 * Again, a "virtual list" is created
 * (the count of messages is known)
 * and for each messages that is scrolled into view, dc_get_msg() is called then.
 *
 * Why no listflags?
 * Without listflags, dc_get_chatlist() adds
 * the archive "link" automatically as needed.
 * The UI can just render these items differently then.
