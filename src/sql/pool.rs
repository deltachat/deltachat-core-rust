//! # SQLite connection pool.
//!
//! The connection pool holds a number of SQLite connections and allows to allocate them.
//! When allocated connection is dropped, underlying connection is returned back to the pool.
//!
//! The pool is organized as a stack. It always allocates the most recently used connection.
//! Each SQLite connection has its own page cache, so allocating recently used connections
//! improves the performance compared to, for example, organizing the pool as a queue
//! and returning the least recently used connection each time.
//!
//! Pool returns at most one write connection (with `PRAGMA query_only=0`).
//! This ensures that there never are multiple write transactions at once.
//!
//! Doing the locking ourselves instead of relying on SQLite has these reasons:
//!
//! - SQLite's locking mechanism is non-async, blocking a thread
//! - SQLite's locking mechanism just sleeps in a loop, which is really inefficient
//!
//! ---
//!
//! More considerations on alternatives to the current approach:
//!
//! We use [DEFERRED](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_transaction.html#deferred_immediate_and_exclusive_transactions) transactions.
//!
//! In order to never get concurrency issues, we could make all transactions IMMEDIATE,
//! but this would mean that there can never be two simultaneous transactions.
//!
//! Read transactions can simply be made DEFERRED to run in parallel w/o any drawbacks.
//!
//! DEFERRED write transactions without doing the locking ourselves would have these drawbacks:
//!
//! 1. As mentioned above, SQLite's locking mechanism is non-async and sleeps in a loop.
//! 2. If there are other write transactions, we block the db connection until
//!    upgraded. If some reader comes then, it has to get the next, less used connection with a
//!    worse per-connection page cache (SQLite allows one write and any number of reads in parallel).
//! 3. If a transaction is blocked for more than `busy_timeout`, it fails with SQLITE_BUSY.
//! 4. If upon a successful upgrade to a write transaction the db has been modified,
//!    the transaction has to be rolled back and retried, which means extra work in terms of
//!    CPU/battery.
//!
//! The only pro of making write transactions DEFERRED w/o the external locking would be some
//! parallelism between them.
//!
//! Another option would be to make write transactions IMMEDIATE, also
//! w/o the external locking. But then cons 1. - 3. above would still be valid.
