This program provides a [JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) interface to DeltaChat
over standard I/O.

Rename the downloaded binary to `deltachat-rpc-server` and add it to your `PATH`.

To install from source run:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/chatmail/core/ deltachat-rpc-server
```

The `deltachat-rpc-server` executable will be installed into `$HOME/.cargo/bin` that should be available

## Usage

To use just run `deltachat-rpc-server` command. The accounts folder will be created in the current

The common use case for this program is to create bindings to use Delta Chat core from programming
languages other than Rust, for example:

1. Python: https://pypi.org/project/deltachat-rpc-client/
2. Go: https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-rpc-client-go/

Run `deltachat-rpc-server --version` to check the version of the server.
Run `deltachat-rpc-server --openrpc` to get [OpenRPC](https://open-rpc.org/) specification of the provided JSON-RPC API.
