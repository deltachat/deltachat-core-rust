The chatmail core library implements low-level network and encryption protocols, 
integrated by many chat bots and higher level applications, 
allowing to securely participate in the globally scaled e-mail server network. 
We provide reproducibly-built `deltachat-rpc-server` static binaries
that offer a stdio-based high-level JSON-RPC API for instant messaging purposes. 

The following protocols are handled without requiring API users to know much about them: 

- secure TLS setup with DNS caching and shadowsocks/proxy support 

- robust [SMTP](https://github.com/chatmail/async-imap) 
  and [IMAP](https://github.com/chatmail/async-smtp) handling

- safe and interoperable [MIME parsing](https://github.com/staktrace/mailparse) 
  and [MIME building](https://github.com/stalwartlabs/mail-builder). 

- security-audited end-to-end encryption with [rPGP](https://github.com/rpgp/rpgp)
  and [Autocrypt and SecureJoin protocols](https://securejoin.rtfd.io)

- ephemeral [Peer-to-Peer networking using Iroh](https://iroh.computer) for multi-device setup and
  [webxdc realtime data](https://delta.chat/en/2024-11-20-webxdc-realtime). 

- a simulation- and real-world tested [P2P group membership
  protocol without requiring server state](https://github.com/chatmail/models/tree/main/group-membership). 


## Installing Rust and Cargo

To download and install the official compiler for the Rust programming language, and the Cargo package manager, run the command in your user environment:

```
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

> On Windows, you may need to also install **Perl** to be able to compile deltachat-core.

## Using the CLI client

Compile and run Delta Chat Core command line utility, using `cargo`:

```
$ cargo run --locked -p deltachat-repl -- ~/deltachat-db
```
where ~/deltachat-db is the database file. Delta Chat will create it if it does not exist.

Optionally, install `deltachat-repl` binary with
```
$ cargo install --locked --path deltachat-repl/
```
and run as
```
$ deltachat-repl ~/deltachat-db
```

Configure your account (if not already configured):

```
Delta Chat Core is awaiting your commands.
> set addr your@email.org
> set mail_pw yourpassword
> configure
```

Connect to your mail server (if already configured):

```
> connect
```

Create a contact:

```
> addcontact yourfriends@email.org
Command executed successfully.
```

List contacts:

```
> listcontacts
Contact#10: <name unset> <yourfriends@email.org>
Contact#1: Me √√ <your@email.org>
```

Create a chat with your friend and send a message:

```
> createchat 10
Single#10 created successfully.
> chat 10
Single#10: yourfriends@email.org [yourfriends@email.org]
> send hi
Message sent.
```

If `yourfriend@email.org` uses DeltaChat, but does not receive message just
sent, it is advisable to check `Spam` folder. It is known that at least
`gmx.com` treat such test messages as spam, unless told otherwise with web
interface.

List messages when inside a chat:

```
> chat
```

For more commands type:

```
> help
```

## Installing libdeltachat system wide

```
$ git clone https://github.com/chatmail/core.git
$ cd deltachat-core-rust
$ cmake -B build . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
$ cmake --build build
$ sudo cmake --install build
```

## Development

```sh
# run tests
$ cargo test --all
# build c-ffi
$ cargo build -p deltachat_ffi --release
```

## Debugging environment variables 

- `DCC_MIME_DEBUG`: if set outgoing and incoming message will be printed 

- `RUST_LOG=async_imap=trace,async_smtp=trace`: enable IMAP and
SMTP tracing in addition to info messages.

### Expensive tests

Some tests are expensive and marked with `#[ignore]`, to run these
use the `--ignored` argument to the test binary (not to cargo itself):
```sh
$ cargo test -- --ignored
```

### Fuzzing

Install [`cargo-bolero`](https://github.com/camshaft/bolero) with
```sh
$ cargo install cargo-bolero@0.8.0
```

Run fuzzing tests with
```sh
$ cd fuzz
$ cargo bolero test fuzz_mailparse --release=false -s NONE
```

Corpus is created at `fuzz/fuzz_targets/corpus`,
you can add initial inputs there.
For `fuzz_mailparse` target corpus can be populated with
`../test-data/message/*.eml`.

To run with AFL instead of libFuzzer:
```sh
$ cargo bolero test fuzz_format_flowed --release=false -e afl -s NONE
```

## Features

- `vendored`: When using Openssl for TLS, this bundles a vendored version.

## Update Provider Data

To add the updates from the
[provider-db](https://github.com/deltachat/provider-db) to the core, run:

```
./src/provider/update.py ../provider-db/_providers/ > src/provider/data.rs
```
